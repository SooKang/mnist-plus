Machine Learning Digit Classification Project
=====
The dataset is based on the MNIST dataset (LeCun, Corte, Burges: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/), with modified images

Implement:  
1. Logistic regression  
2. Feedforward Neural Network   
3. Linear SVM (from toolbox)   
4. Convolutional Neural Network (Caffe)
